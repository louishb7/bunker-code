# BunkerCode

> Map your system before changing it.

BunkerCode is a local-first application for investigating software architecture, dependencies, diagnostics, impact, and historical changes.

## Usage

Analyze a local TypeScript project with a `tsconfig.json`:

```bash
pnpm --silent analyze fixtures/simple-import
```

The command writes deterministic JSON to `stdout` with:

- `analysis`: the TypeScript analyzer contract;
- `graph`: the language-independent project graph;
- `diagnostics`: evidence-backed architectural diagnostics.

The `analysis` payload is deterministic, serializable, and serves as Snapshot V1
for the browser frontier.

Query file-level structural impact with a project-relative target path:

```bash
pnpm --silent impact fixtures/simple-import src/service.ts
```

The command writes deterministic JSON to `stdout` with the target file, direct
and transitive dependents, propagation depth, shortest impact paths, and
factual circularity evidence for the target when applicable.

When the target is a PNPM workspace root, the analyzer detects packages declared
by `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, builds a file-level graph across their TypeScript
projects, and includes structural containment plus package dependency aggregation
in the `analyze` JSON. This repository itself can therefore be analyzed with:

```bash
pnpm --silent analyze .
```

Package roots without their own `tsconfig.json` remain structurally visible but
do not contribute TypeScript files to that workspace analysis.

Argument and analysis errors are written to `stderr` and return a non-zero exit code.

## Validation

Run the standard deterministic checks:

```bash
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
```

Run the real browser frontier check when local Firefox access is available:

```bash
pnpm test:browser
```

The browser check uses `puppeteer-core` with the system Firefox executable at
`/usr/bin/firefox`. Override it with `BUNKERCODE_BROWSER_EXECUTABLE` when needed.

## Explorer spike

The Phase 2A Explorer renders the real, disposable `AnalysisResult` derived from
`packages/analyzer-typescript`. Generate its snapshot and start the local app:

```bash
pnpm --filter @bunker-code/explorer-web dev
```

Build the Web application with:

```bash
pnpm --filter @bunker-code/explorer-web build
```

The generated snapshot at `apps/explorer-web/src/generated/` is ignored by Git.
Source code remains the source of truth; regenerate the snapshot after analyzer
changes rather than treating it as persisted Explorer data.

The Explorer can find internal files by path or file name. Selecting a search
result centers it; selecting a result outside the current focus context returns
to overview so the file is visible before it is selected.
