> Map your system before changing it.

BunkerCode is a local-first application for investigating software architecture, dependencies, diagnostics, impact, and historical changes.

## Usage

Analyze a local TypeScript project with a `tsconfig.json`:

```bash
pnpm --silent analyze fixtures/simple-import
```

The command writes deterministic JSON to `stdout` with:

- `analysis`: the TypeScript analyzer contract;
- `graph`: the language-independent project graph;
- `diagnostics`: evidence-backed architectural diagnostics.

Query file-level structural impact with a project-relative target path:

```bash
pnpm --silent impact fixtures/simple-import src/service.ts
```

The command writes deterministic JSON to `stdout` with the target file, direct
and transitive dependents, propagation depth, shortest impact paths, and
factual circularity evidence for the target when applicable.

Argument and analysis errors are written to `stderr` and return a non-zero exit code.
